/****************,QUESTION,**************

Youâ€™re given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.

If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.

Example :

Input : [1 2 3 1 1]
Output : 1 
1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times. 


/***************,APPROACH,*************
As the question says N/3 repeat, the N can be changed by removing 3 distinct elements. 
Which means, if I'm taking distinct elements out of N, we just need to find out (N-3)/3 repeat number (same as N/3 repeat number)
In other words, answer doesn't change if we remove 3 distinct elements. 
To implement this, we take 2 variables first and second, with their corresponding counts firstC and secondC.
Whenever a new element is seen, it must be either of them. If not, we decrement both of them so that, new one can b accommodated.
